# Global imports:
import mock

import sys
import unittest

# To perform local imports first we need to fix PYTHONPATH:
pwd = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(pwd + '/../../modules/'))

# Local imports:
import file_paths as paths
import inventory_tool

class TestInventoryTool(unittest.TestCase):
